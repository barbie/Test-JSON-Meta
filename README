DESCRIPTION

Validation of the META.json file in a CPAN distribution.

This module was written to ensure that a META.json file, provided with a 
standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are
slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of package makers and
installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.

Current CPAN META Specification, 2.0, was finally approved in April 2010, 
which forms the basis for the contents of a META.json file. The full 
specification is now included with the CPAN-Meta distribution.
